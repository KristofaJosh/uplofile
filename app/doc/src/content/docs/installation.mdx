Uplofile is a composable file upload component for React. It allows you to build your own UI with small, accessible primitives: contextâ€‘driven Root, Trigger, Dropzone, Preview, and helpers for cancel/retry/remove â€” with progress and dragâ€‘andâ€‘drop.

- React 16+ compatible
- Drag & drop, clickâ€‘toâ€‘upload, and renderâ€‘props APIs
- Progress, cancel, retry, and optimistic/strict remove flows
- Hidden input with JSON of successful uploads for regular form submits
- You can style however you like (Tailwind recommended)


## Install

You can add Uplofile to your project site by installing the `uplofile` package. Follow these steps:


<Steps>
1. Select your package manager:
    <PackageManager pkg="astro" exec="add uplofile" />

2. Create a file `file-uploader.tsx` in your `src/components` directory

3. Copy and paste the following code:
    <Code title={'file-uploader.tsx'} lang="tsx" code={importedCode} />

4. Then import and use in your app.

5. You're done! ðŸŽ‰
</Steps>

### Styling

- Bring your own styles or Tailwind. The package includes default styles with Tailwind.
