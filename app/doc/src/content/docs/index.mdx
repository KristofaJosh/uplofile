import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Examples

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Composable" icon="pencil">
        Headless primitives — `Root`, `Trigger`, `Preview`, `Dropzone`, `HiddenInput` — so you can compose any UI while Uplofile handles state and actions.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Accessible" icon="add-document">
        Keyboard and screen‑reader friendly, Works without drag‑and‑drop.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Stylable" icon="setting">
        Unstyled by default. Use your own CSS, Tailwind, or design system; render‑props give full control over markup, classes, and interactions.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Read the docs" icon="open-book">
        Learn more in [the uplofile docs](/installation).
    </Card>
</CardGrid>

## FAQ

<details>
    <summary>Can I limit the number of files?</summary>
    Use `maxCount` on `Root`.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Can I pre‑hydrate already‑uploaded files?</summary>
    Pass <code>initial=[&#123; id, uid, name, url &#125;]</code> (id/uid optional). They’ll be shown as done and included in <code>HiddenInput</code>.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How do I do strict server‑side delete?</summary>
    Set `removeMode="strict"` and implement `onRemove(item, signal)`.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Do I have to use Tailwind?</summary>
    No. The components are unstyled besides minimal examples; you can render your own UI with the render props and actions.
